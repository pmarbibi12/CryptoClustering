# Purpose:
- The purpose of this project is to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies based on data extracted from the provided CSV file, "crypto_market_data.csv."

# Summary:
- Using Pandas and Scikit-learn (sklearn), we will build and format dataframes to prepare them for clustering analysis.
- We will then compare and contrast different clustering approaches, specifically KMeans and PCA, to determine which method is more effective at creating meaningful clusters of cryptocurrencies.
- Finally, we will visualize our findings using the "hvplot.pandas" library to provide insights into the clustering results.

# Disclaimer:
- The code used in this Jupyter Notebook project was adapted from examples in the Data Analysis Bootcamp - 20 - Unsupervised Learning.
